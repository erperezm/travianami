## About the Game

This game is a real-time, browser-based strategy game inspired by the classic *Travian*. Players can build their own villages, form alliances, train armies, and wage war for dominance on the world map. Set in an ancient world, you will need to gather resources, expand your empire, and outsmart your rivals through clever tactics and strategic diplomacy.

One unique aspect of this game is the presence of **different races**, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as **customizable heroes** that lead your armies into battle.

## Features

- **Village Building**: Develop your village by constructing buildings and upgrading infrastructure.
- **Resource Management**: Collect and manage resources like wood, clay, iron, and food to grow your empire.
- **Army Training**: Train different types of military units to defend your village or attack others.
- **World Map Exploration**: Interact with other players' villages and NPC-controlled areas on a shared world map.
- **Races and Heroes**: Choose from a variety of races, each with unique units, abilities, and heroes.
- **Hero System**: Customize your hero with special skills and equipment to enhance your army's performance.
- **Alliance System**: Join forces with other players to create alliances, plan coordinated attacks, and defend each other.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Actions like building, upgrading, and attacking occur in real time, adding strategic depth to decision-making.
- **PvP & PvE**: Engage in player-versus-player combat, or challenge NPCs for additional rewards.
- **Leaderboards**: Compete against other players and climb the ranks on global leaderboards.

## Races and Heroes

In this game, players can select from **multiple races**, each offering unique traits, units, and advantages:

### Races

#### 1. **Elves**
Elves are swift and strategic, relying on their mystical creatures to outmaneuver their enemies. They excel against Goblins and Humans but struggle against the might of Dragons and Manticores.

#### 2. **Dragons**
Dragons are powerful and fearsome, dominating the battlefield with their overwhelming strength. They are particularly strong against Elves and Goblins but have weaknesses when facing Valkyries.

#### 3. **Goblins**
Goblins thrive on chaos and brute force. Their units are strong against Dragons and Humans, but they tend to struggle when facing the agility and cunning of the Elves.

#### 4. **Humans**
Humans are balanced, with a mix of offensive and defensive units. They can counter races like Wyverns and Manticores, but they tend to falter against the speed and magic of the Elves and Ogres.
